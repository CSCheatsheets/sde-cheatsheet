# Scalability - Concept

## Strong Scalability

Scale up the number of processors while not scaling up the problem size. It's
intended to test the latency (how fast the system can process the same problem).

## Weak Scalability

Scale up the number of processors and scale up the problem size. It's intended
to test the throughput (how much more problems can the system process).
